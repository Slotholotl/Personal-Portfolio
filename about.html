            <h1>Remi Soffner</h1>
        <p>
            I was born April 10th 2004 in a small appertment in Amsterdam. <br>
            As I grew up I wanted to do a lot of things such as: <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Graphic Design</li>
                <li>Music</li>
                <li>Commentary</li>
                <li>Cooking</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                I now live in Zaandam and study Software Development at MediaCollege,
                and I hope to achieve the skill to become a talented Full-Stack-Developer.
                <br>
                <br>
                But before I enrolled into this class I studied to become a Standalone Cheff. <br>
                Though I actually wanted to become a full time musician as I love making music. <br>
                I applied for a school but not in time so i had to wait for my next shot which i did get. <br>
                I had spent about 2 years in the field of music but school as it usually does made it feel like a chore,
                and so I decided to try out programming which leads me to today.

          <h1>Zaandam</h1>
          <p>
            Zaandam is a nice city in North-Holland above the infamous city Amsterdam. <br>
            Its econemy thrives off of tourist as it is a cheaper alternative
            than to stay and book an hotel at Amsterdam.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also mainly know for its dreamliike aesthetic found at the station.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1>Hobbies</h1>
          <p>
              In my free time I usually like to play guitar, bass, sing and produce songs. <br>
              I also play a lot of brawlhalla and minecraft. I used to play Aion but i feel they ruined it
              as of now the actual game is dead because everyone is max level and the "new game" has a 
              payed subscription which i think is total bs as the game beforehand used to be free to play.
          </p>
